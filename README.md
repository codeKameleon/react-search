# React Search
This project is a small search reusable component created with React and styled components. I also used the [Buzzprout API](https://www.buzzsprout.com/api) to collect data from a personnal podcast project.

## Usage

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
